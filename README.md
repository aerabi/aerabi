Hi, I'm a software developer and hobbyist mathematician.

- ðŸ”­ As a fulltime employee, Iâ€™m coding in TypeScript (back and front) and creating CI/CD pipelines.
- ðŸŒ± As a student, Iâ€™m currently implementing a [linear temporal type system](https://github.com/aerabi/lttt) for event-based reactive programming, in Coq.
- ðŸ‘¯ As an open-source contributor, Iâ€™m looking developing [Mongo-CI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-ci) npm package, as well as [RxJS Pipe Extentions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rxjs-pipe-ext).

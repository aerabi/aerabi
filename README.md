Hi, I'm a software developer and mathematician (e.g. I know why $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$).

- 🧑‍💼 As a fulltime employee, I code in TypeScript (back and front) and create CI/CD pipelines.
- 🧑‍💻 As an open-source contributor, I’m mostly contributing to [RxJSx](https://www.npmjs.com/rxjsx) as well as [Mongo-CI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-ci).
- 🧑‍🎓 As a life-time learner, I'm currently researching in [linear-time temporal logic](https://github.com/aerabi/heartbeat-poster).
